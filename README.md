## Motivation

Décio Bazin and Benjamin Graham's investment principles offer solutions to the challenges faced by novice investors in the stock market.

Décio Bazin, like Graham, emphasizes the importance of value investing. Novice investors often struggle with understanding how to identify stocks that are genuinely undervalued. Bazin's principles encourage investors to focus on a company's dividend history and stability as a key indicator of its financial health and potential for long-term growth. This approach provides a clear and systematic way for beginners to assess the value of stocks, helping them overcome the challenge of identifying solid investment opportunities.

Benjamin Graham's principles address another common hurdle for new investors: market volatility and emotional decision-making. Many beginners are prone to making impulsive investment decisions based on short-term market fluctuations and headlines. Graham's approach emphasizes fundamental analysis, looking at a company's financials and intrinsic value rather than getting swayed by market sentiment. This discipline helps novice investors avoid the pitfall of emotional trading and make more rational, informed decisions.

In summary, Décio Bazin and Benjamin Graham's investment principles provide valuable guidance for novice investors by helping them navigate the challenges of identifying undervalued stocks and avoiding emotional decision-making. Their systematic and disciplined approaches empower beginners to build a strong foundation for successful long-term investing in the stock market.
